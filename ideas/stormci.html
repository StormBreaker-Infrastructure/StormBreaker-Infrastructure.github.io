        <h3>Mentor :- Saalim</h3>
        <br>
        StormCI Application is written in Kotlin and is designed in XML layouts where we provide information about the device software (kernel-version and device codename).
        <br>
        Information about the supported devices that can execute our software and the team members that worked on it are displayed by the application using retrofit libraries and recyclerView.

                Software won't feel good until it has a good user interface.<br>
                The idea here is to mainly discuss the UI of the application along with the UI/UX team and design them accordingly on the application.<br>

                Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture is one of the best in the Android industry.<br>
                In order to support the MVVM design, we intend to modify the application.<br>
