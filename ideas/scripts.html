        <h3>Mentor :- Saalim and Giovanni</h3>

        The CI scripts comprises of a master build script that takes in device name as the argument and triggers build
        from our main device organisation (https://github.com/stormbreaker-project).
        <br>
        The script clones the device kernel and builds the config (assuming you are familiar to how the Linux Kernel is built).
        <br>
        The script selects Android Clang 10.0 as default version and works only for Linux Kernel version 3.18.
        <br>
        We work only with Long Term Support type Kernels.

        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first thing that the repository lacks is a well written documentation.<br>
                The aim of this is to write proper documentation for each wrapper function defined in the script,<br>
                as well as the code flow of the scripts and how to use them.

                <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                The build script usually needs an argument everytime in order to execute and for multiple executions,<br>
                it is required to run the script multiple times for every execution.<br>
                The idea here is to make a master generic script that will contain the required functions that takes in variables as arguments,<br>
                and trigger the builds.<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                The build script supports only Linux Kernel LTS 3.18 version for now which is considered as EOL.<br>
                To expand the script support, it is required to add more LTS version support.<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                Linux Kernels are able to support different compilers whether it be GCC, LLVM, Google Clang, etc.<br>
                The idea is to add the support for the kernel to be able to build with a different compiler we want.<br>
