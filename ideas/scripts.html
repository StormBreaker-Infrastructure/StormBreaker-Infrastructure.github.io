        <h1>StormBreakerCI</h1>
        <h3>Mentor :- Saalim and Giovanni</h3><br>

        The CI scripts comprises of a master build script that takes in device name as the argument and triggers build
        from our main device organisation (https://github.com/stormbreaker-project).
        The script clones the device kernel and builds the config (assuming you are familiar to how the Linux Kernel is built).
        The script selects Android Clang 10.0 as default version and works only for Linux Kernel version 3.18.
        We work only with Long Term Support type Kernels.

        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The build script usually needs an argument everytime in order to execute and for multiple executions,<br>
                it is required to run the script multiple times for every execution.<br>
                The idea here is to make a master generic script that will contain the required functions that takes in variables as arguments,<br>
                and trigger the builds.<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                The build script supports only Linux Kernel LTS 3.18 version for now which is considered as EOL.<br>
                To expand the script support, it is required to add more LTS version support.<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                Linux Kernels are able to support different compilers whether it be GCC, LLVM, Google Clang, etc.<br>
                The idea is to add the support for the kernel to be able to build with a different compiler we want.<br>
